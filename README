README

Due to OS X packaging quirks, you'll need to massage the build slightly.
I've tried to add build scripts to do this, but I'm not convinced that they work properly. If they don't, you'll need to use 'install_name_tool -change' to force the library look-ups to match :


libIex (in the plugin and also the libImath library in Frameworks):
	@loader_path/../Frameworks/libIex.7.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 1.0.3)

libImath (in the plugin):
	@loader_path/../Frameworks/libImath.7.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 1.0.3)
